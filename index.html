                    In a significant stride towards the intersection of technology and healthcare, my partner and I at
                    university have successfully developed an innovative brain tumor detection tool using a Regional
                    Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN). This cutting-edge project stands at the forefront of biomedical
                    computing, seamlessly blending advanced neural network algorithms with critical medical imaging
                    techniques. Our creation is not just a testament to our expertise in machine learning and data
                    analysis, but also a potential game-changer in medical diagnostics. The tool is designed to
                    accurately and efficiently identify brain tumors, paving the way for quicker, more reliable
                    diagnoses and, consequently, more effective treatment plans. This accomplishment is a prime example
                    of how technology, when applied thoughtfully, can have a profound impact on healthcare, offering
                    hope for improved patient outcomes and revolutionizing the approach towards medical challenges."

                    The aim of this project was to develop a web application designed to detect brain tumors
                    from MRI scans. Initially, we focused on binary classification, distinguishing between the
                    presence and absence of tumors. However, our long-term goal was to extend the application's
                    capabilities to identify various types of brain tumors. To achieve this, we leveraged a Regional
                    Convolutional Neural Network (RCNN) to pinpoint the precise areas in the brain that may contain
                    tumors. We made use of the U-NET achitecture to reach this goal. U-Net is a popular deep-learning
                    architecture for semantic segmentation. Originally developed for medical images, it had great
                    success in this field.
